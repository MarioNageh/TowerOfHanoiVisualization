Tower of Hanoi is a classic puzzle game that challenges players to move a stack of disks from one peg to another, following strict rules about how the disks can be moved. With my Tower of Hanoi visualization project, you can explore this puzzle in a new way, with vibrant graphics, interactive features, and a user-friendly interface.

Using Python and the Pygame library, I created a Tower of Hanoi game that displays the three pegs and a stack of disks that can be moved from peg to peg. The game includes customizable settings for the number of disks , so you can tailor the experience to your preferences.

One of the standout features of this project is the smooth animation and visual effects that make it easy to see exactly how the disks are being moved and arranged. You can also keep track of your moves and try to solve the puzzle in as few moves as possible, or simply enjoy the process of manipulating the disks and experimenting with different strategies.

Overall, my Tower of Hanoi visualization project is a fun and engaging way to explore this classic puzzle and challenge your spatial reasoning and problem-solving skills. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced puzzler, you're sure to find something to enjoy in this interactive and visually appealing game.
